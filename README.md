Hi there,

This is Tim. 

Gathering and collectiong pieces of code here. 
Mostly interesting in developing opportunities that outstanding opportunities Python is doomed to give us. 

Currently I'm here mostly for: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, various modules to connect and parse data like cx_Oracle. 
On my way for putting out regression model and something user-friendly in web framework. 

If anything is up, contact me through suggestions of repository.
